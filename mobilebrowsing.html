    <p>This activity was very interesting and enlightening. Since most of my browsing is on a laptop, there is a major difference obviously in the size of the screen. This causes more problems than I had initially assumed. However, almost all websites have figured out solutions to the change in screen sizes. Some of them simply rearrange the images, however some websites require more drastic changes or removal of entire images. However, with what I was able to see, most sites looked almost exactly the same, only shifted to the middle and slimmed down. I found it very simple to navigate most mobile sites and the only exceptions were certain features such as menu bars not following the scroll or some links that were no longer clickable. Overall I would say that mobile browsing is more accessable and easier than I expected. Most companies have obviously gone to great lengths to make their sites mobile-friendly. </p>
